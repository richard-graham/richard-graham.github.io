        <h1>Sprint 2 - Learning Agreement</h1>
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
        <p>My strengths are my ability to work with others and my passion when it comes to learning things I'm interested in. My weaknesses are my problem solving skills and my ability to feel frustrated if I'm not understanding a concept.</p>
        <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
        <p>I will use timers to manage my time spent on each segment. I will try to keep ahead of my workload so as to give myself the time needed to fully understand concepts.</p>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>I will initially try to solve any problems I am having on my own, if the resource I am using doesn't seem to be working I will atempt to use another to see if that makes it clearer, in the event that I am still unable to understand a concept I will contact Kelly my facilitator. I will also spend time AT devAcademy and rely on those close to me who are experienced programmers.</p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        <p>Support when needed. I expect the team to be available when needed but only after I've spent a reasonable amount of time trying to solve the problem myself.</p>
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in. These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</h3>
        <p>I knew that Dev devAcademy was going to be very intensive so have left myself the time to fully focus on learning while I am with you guys.</p>
